There are many factors that attribute to the success rate of these events such as location, timing, gender ratio, available space, marketing, and music. This study hopes to examine the nature of them by accessing data from &lt;a href="https://dev.twitter.com/"&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://instagram.com/"&gt;instagram&lt;/a&gt; in order to determine how successful it can be. We will be focusing on girl to guy ratio (emphasis on the girls) as well as time of day the events are posted to social networks.  A friend of mine (wassup Cam!!) had a party on a pretty big weekend in our city and I figured that it would be the perfect time to collect some data. Using &lt;a href="https://google-developers.appspot.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/piechart"&gt;google charts &lt;/a&gt; I was able to generate these cool charts. Check them out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="https://www.google.com/jsapi"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;  
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;  
  google.load("visualization", '1.1', {packages:['corechart']});
  google.setOnLoadCallback(drawChart);
  function drawChart() {
    var oldData = google.visualization.arrayToDataTable(
      [
       ['Gender', 'Total'],
          ['Male',     51],
          ['Female',      77]]

      )

    ;

    var newData = google.visualization.arrayToDataTable([
       ['Social Medium', 'Total'],
          ['Instagram',     71],
          ['Twitter',     39],
          ['Word of mouth',      20]]);

    var social_options = { pieSliceText: 'none', is3D:true, title:"Social Media data"};
    var gender_options = { pieSliceText: 'none', is3D:true, title:"Gender ratio"};

    var chartBefore = new google.visualization.PieChart(document.getElementById('piechart_before'));
    var chartAfter = new google.visualization.PieChart(document.getElementById('piechart_after'));


    chartBefore.draw(oldData, gender_options);
    chartAfter.draw(newData, social_options);


  }
&lt;/script&gt;  

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="piechart_before" style="width: 450px; display: inline-block"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;span id="piechart_after" style="width: 450px; display: inline-block"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="conclusion"&gt;CONCLUSION:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the party was reaching its peak the feds came through and shut it down, so no after party information was collected, but in case you were wondering it was live!!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Final Four Map</title><description>&lt;p&gt;I'm not going to lie, as odd as it may seem I don't follow sports too much.

The arguments my friends have is the closet thing to ESPN to me. Anyway, during the national championship I thought it would be cool to scrape some data from Twitter just to see what folks were talking about.I believe I got roughly 11000 tweets. Check it out.. &lt;strong&gt;Oh yeah it is interactive, so click around and see who was hating.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
